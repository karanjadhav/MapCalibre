Hello,
This is the Static Map based Android Application we created as a entry project.
The App is still in development phase, so new modifications will be coming as soon as we get new ideas and resources to implement.

What the app can do?

This app tells you the location (also address and contact numbers) of Hospitals, Blood Banks, Medicals, Banks and ATMs.
This app is based on static map where we have prefetched the data, so as for now no live facilities would be available.

Hope you all like this project.
